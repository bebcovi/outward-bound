From Monday, August 13th 'till Friday, August 17th 2012, our instructing team gathered in a small Village called Veliki Žitnik, not far from Gospić, on a mission to restore and renovate the area of our new center in Outward Bound Croatia.

The school building waited for years for someone to visit, repaint it, renew it, and fill it’s halls with young people’s shouts and ambition. Our team was well prepared, from old shoes, working clothes, to the rations of pasta and pate, we were ready for whatever may come.

We quickly assigned teams, one team scrambled to build a fireplace and clean the area from shrubs and bushes, old bulkheads and roof tiles that were lying all around. Another team climbed up on the roof to start cleaning and painting the old rusty tin with fresh coats of protective paint. The Sun was hot while we were up there, of course, only to wait for us to climb down, when torrenting rain attempted to wash our paint away. Borna was a team in himself, with a short but important caving task of descending to the bottom of the waste pit to assist in taking out a rock that has fallen down, since he was the only one who never tried doing that before.

The roof eventually got it’s three new coats of paint, and besides other manual tasks, the most important thing was how well the local folk received us, inviting us over for a shot or two, and always ready to help with loaning the equipment like ladders, trolleys and other essentials.

The whole endeavor was visited by two of our international guests, from Scotland and Finland, from where the exec. director of Outward Bound Finland came, while they were both on a holiday in Croatia. They treated us with their company, lots of tea and a heap of pancakes that are made from powder!

After five days, lots of sweat, and with the help of many liters of tea, cedevita and other beverages, we accomplished more than we hoped for, bringing the building one step closer to becoming useable. Next phase is installing the kitchen and pretty soon our new school might be ready to recive the first groups of new participants in Outward Bound!

From 25th September to 6th October, Outward Bound Croatia gathered together twenty two young people from five European countries to participate in an international adventure called "Inside Out – inner development through outdoor activities".

They spent twelve memorable days together on an Outward Bound course, developing skills and knowledge that many of them never thought achievable. They were building shelters, walking for hours, cooking on an open fire, getting lost in the vastness of the Velebit mountain, finding their way, mastering ropes, discussing in circles, playing games, climbing rocks, helping each other and slowly but steadily becoming a powerful team of confident young people – The Wild Ones!

A new challenge waited for them when they got off the mountain – The Wild Ones had to organize an Inside Out event for the children of the island of Rab. In cooperation with Rab’s youth organization "Kocka", they renovated the children’s playground in Palit, and organized  there the Inside Out games for a group of local children. The Games consisted of the elements of their national outdoor games, which they had presented to each other during the exchange. For a day, this little playground on Rab turned into a colorful arena of Lithuanian, Slovenian, Romanian, Croatian and Latvian games that formed a memorable intercultural sports puzzle.

On 6th October, these twenty two young people left the island of Rab determined to transfer their powerful experiences to their daily lives and organize similar events in their communities, thus enhancing the quality of their own lives and the lives of their communities.

The project was organized through the Youth in Action program, which gave these remarkable young people the opportunity to grow and develop their personal and community skills in an unique and inspiring way – the Outward Bound way.
