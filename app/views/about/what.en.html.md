**Outward bound schools** are conducting outdoor courses in nature where participants find themselves outside their everyday lives, where they can discover themselves and their inner abilities. They gain awareness of positive interaction with other members of the group and the environment thus enhancing their personal and social skills.

**Outward Bound courses** are based on experiential learning method. This means stepping outside the usual situations and getting into more challenging environment, both physically and mentally. With reflection to every new experience, the participants gain awareness of themselves and the way they function in certain situations which can later help them to alter their way of thinking should they choose to. This creates more options in going through life and thus more success.

**Objectives** of an Outward Bound course can be quite different depending on the target group and can be one or more of the following:

-	getting to know oneâ€™s own qualities and capabilities
-	teamwork training
-	developing initiative and leadership skills, effective communication skills, organizational skills
