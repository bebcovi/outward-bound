A biologist at heart, Juraj is in the wild more comfortable than at home. But, since he takes his education as a "hobby", he was free to take on other challenges, which eventually led him to OB, whose vision enabled him to mix his love for the mountains with his obsession of "saving the world". He’s been at OBC since the very beginning, and is collecting skills along the way, from caving, climbing, to kayaking and sailing. With a characteristic black humor, and being an irreparable philosopher, in some ways Juraj is like a mountain: mostly quiet and calm, but when he starts, you can’t shut him up. In OBC, he’s in charge of training development and being also artistically inclined, he serves as a graphic designer and web-maintenance.
