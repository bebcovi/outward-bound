## Course objectives

Personal growth and development of new skills through experiential learning in nature.

## Who can participate?

Anyone who wants to improve their communication skills, working with others in a group, organizational and leadership skills and to better get to know themselves through new experiences in natural environments.

## Method

Experiential learning is based on putting participants in new situations, outside their everyday environment. In the nature, it is very important to work together on different tasks which creates a sense of personal responsibility and respect for every member of the team. Course is carefully designed to create a strong and impactful experience which empowers people in tackling their everyday situations with more confidence and ease.

## Course curriculum

As with any interesting experience (like watching a film) it is most fun when it is unexpected. This is why the course details are withheld to be discovered on the course. What follows is short description of the programme:

Upon arriving at the course location first task is to get to know everyone in the group. Throughout next several days this process continues with the help of interesting and adventurous activities like: free climbing, caving, team assignment and many other activities. After developing adventurous spirit, the group embarks on multi-day expedition which includes peak ascent and sleeping outdoors. With many new experiences, the group is returning to camp for celebration on the last day after which everyone returns to their homes.

Besides the classic courses, like 8-day Velebit Adventure, OBC also offers tailor-made courses, on a location in your vicinity.

If you know what you want to address within the team you are working with, our instructors will help you come up with a programme to meet your specific needs, defining your own goals and contents for maximal impact.
