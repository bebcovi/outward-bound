"Velebit adventure" has all the high adventure you may ever desire, climbing technical peaks, camping in pristine meadows and coming back-to-back with Croatia’s outback. It is our first course that was ever done by Outward Bound here in Croatia.

The course takes participants from the hinterland over mountains to the sea. Over 8 days you will get the opportunity to cook over open fire, learn how to navigate difficult mountain terrain, learn survival techniques for living in the outdoors, meet great people and build friendships that may very well last a lifetime.

The Classic Velebit Course is a great way to experience the forgotten wilderness of Croatia. As so many people head to the coast we will be high above, traversing the mountains with a birds eye view of what is to come.

Outward Bound is formed around the idea that people work best when they are aligned with their inner values. It was founded in 1941. as a development program for youth, and today it has expanded to working with individuals, groups and professional teams. To be ‘’Outward Bound’’ is to be ready for a challenge, to develop leadership and responsibility for own life and to continue to contribute to community that we are all a part of.

Velebit Adventure is a unique 8-day course in which participants have an opportunity to discover the range of their abilities and personal strength, which they can late apply to any situation that life presents them. In the untouched wilderness of Mt. Velebit, they face the unpredictability of nature, learning to work in a team, while conquering the challenging activities and mountain peaks, as well as the summits of their spirit. From the course, they return stronger, and with more courage and commitment to accomplish their goals in life.
