*Sail the islands of the Adriatic, brave the open sea, work as a team and be a part of Croatian maritime heritage...*

## Outward Bound Sea School

The Outward Bound Sea School promotes the Maritime traditions of Croatia as a means for young people to learn the values that seafaring has taught for generations; Leadership, Courage, Responsibility, Cooperation, Generosity, Environmental Stewardship and Respect.

We have opportunities for sailors young and old to discover their roots and sail on the beautiful Bente Dorte, a traditionally rigged sailboat, and to discover the Croatian coast in a new way.

Students will get the opportunity to learn traditional navigation, sail handling, safety at sea, come visit uninhabited islands, camp in the open air.

Outward Bound Sea School offers this exciting new trip to experience sailing on this magnificent traditional vessel. You may be one of a very few people in the world to have this truly unique experience.

**Trip duration**: 8 days
