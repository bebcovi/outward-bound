## Team development

Teams exist in many forms, from the football field to the boardroom. There are just as many teams as there are ways to manage them. Effective teams are the key to achieving success. In this era when businesses are trying to do more with fewer resources, teams are more important than ever.<br>
We use experiential learning to help the team develop skills, which in turn enables members to work more efficiently in the group. In active engagement individuals perform tasks, which allow them to see how their performance can enhance results. As the team works together, we work with the group to enhance their effectiveness.<br>
Following the activities, we work with group members to facilitate reviews, reflect on performance and discover ways to improve. Together we analyze group dynamics and interactions. After one of our programs, the team will be equipped to tackle future tasks with more skill and efficiency. Back on the job the or in the office, new tools and techniques for communication and group dynamics can be implemented immediately.

## Action-Based Learning
The Outward Bound method is called -- **The Action Learning Cycle**: People perform an action, then reflect on what they learned. From this comes new ideas and approaches, from which new behaviors are adopted.

## Phase I -- Assessment

We perform interviews, questionnaires and meetings with the company’s top executives and some course participants to determine program scope, goals and desired results. Using data from the online Leadership Development Profile, we custom design the successive phases.

## Phase II -- Design

We tailor programs to build on the existing strengths of your company while focusing on individual, team and organizational needs and objectives.

## Phase III -- Delivery

Our programs use a combination of experiential problem-solving exercises, ropes courses and wilderness expeditions as vehicles to explore individual and organizational behavior. These elements allow groups to explore the complexities of working together while analyzing critical factors of success and growth in order to apply those lessons to the work environment.

## Phase IV -- Follow Up

Working with clients after the program ensures that the key elements and behavioral changes are incorporated into the work culture.
