    The Outward Bound program is an educational program involving indoor and outdoor sports and recreational activities. The basic method is learning by experience, which means the possibility to participate in unusual activities, to experiment with different solutions and new behaviours, and to work in a group with other participantsas well as individually.

    The activities can include hiking, climbing, abseiling and ropes-course elements, as well as group tasks that include more or less physical effort. The programs are designed to fit the participantsâ€™ needs and abilities. Participants may choose not to actively participate in an activity but they still must be present for all activities.

    The activities are coordinated by qualified, experienced instructors, who take care of both the physical and mental safety of the participants.  

    Some activities involve physical exertion, as well as known and unknown risks. I hereby accept to use all equipment and apparatus provided by Outward Bound Croatia and to comply with any rules and regulations designed to serve the safety and well-being of all participants.

    I shall comply with the training conditions and regulations which include no smoking and consumption of alcoholic drinks and drugs. I shall also fully co-operate with the instructions and staff of the Outward Bound Croatia.
